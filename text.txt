It was 5 interviews, pair programming on data structure and code structure, one system design, one manager interview and one values interview.
Each interview was about an hour, each with only one person. All interviewers were very nice and polite. I had a very good experience overall.
For the coding interviews it is important to do TDD. They start from a simple problem then requirement is changed to be more complicated and this goes on as long as there is time.


- The data structure: count and rate teams votes that can be found on leetcode.
- The code structure: design a routing class
- System design: design a tagging service for different Atlassian products
- Manager interview: focus on collaboration within the team, resolve conflicts, etc to see if the candidate is a good fit for the team
- Values interview: focused on customer empathy and checks whether candidate is a good fit for the company (is aligned with the company values)
