It was 5 interviews, pair programming on data structure and code structure, one system design, one manager interview and one values interview.
Each interview was about an hour, each with only one person. All interviewers were very nice and polite. I had a very good experience overall.
For the coding interviews it is important to do TDD. They start from a simple problem then requirement is changed to be more complicated and this goes on as long as there is time.


- The data structure: count and rate teams votes that can be found on leetcode.
- The code structure: design a routing class
- System design: design a tagging service for different Atlassian products
- Manager interview: focus on collaboration within the team, resolve conflicts, etc to see if the candidate is a good fit for the team
- Values interview: focused on customer empathy and checks whether candidate is a good fit for the company (is aligned with the company values)


Browser Coding - Create a file directory structure using some JSON data provided
Javascript Interview - Make an async promise call from a function and display data in paginated format. Then kept scaling up the question.

=====================================================================================================================================================

Applied online and the recruiter contacted me for an initial discussion. Recruiter asked some basic questions and put me through to the next coding interviews. I was told 2 rounds, one was more of code design round and another was data structures.

For design round, I was asked to write code for a snake game, and I felt it was bit odd to ask that in the code design round as it involved using linked lists and it took a while to get the data structure implemented and to get the core game logic coded and didn't had enough time to actually showcase code structure/design experience.

Second round, counting votes question as mentioned by others here, but the interviewer didn't explain the problem correctly and I had to ask multiple times to get a clear understanding of the question which itself took first 20 minutes, and by the time I was close to completing the code, time was over and we had to end.

Snake game and counting votes

Round 1: design a sample router
Round 2: design a voting system


1. Design a rate limiter.
2. Design a file tag system or voting system.
3. Design a tagging system for Atlassian Products.
4. Questions about Atlassian values.
5. Questions about your professional experience.


==========================================================================

What tests do you perform before deploying a new feature?

======================================================================================================

a token assignment algorithm.

Code design round - I was given the question to write a Rate limiter which they do most of the time.
Unlike what the name suggests, it's not a code design round but was a coding round where they judge you on program correctness rather than LLD.
I gave an implementation of a Rate limiter based on the sliding window algorithm but the interviewer asked me to implement the token bucket algorithm which he knew about.
All the time the interviewer behaved like he was the smartest person. He was not collaborative, not open to solutions which he did not know.

================================================================================================================

Q1 - Given a list of files with multiple tags associated with them, group the files based on tags and return a list of top tags based on total file size.
Q2 - Design a Rate limiter.

===================================================================================================================

Round 1: Standard leetcode easy
Round 2: Code Design, main focus was on oops concept
Round 3: leetcode easy

=======================================================================================================================

First Round : A project was given and had to identify bugs
Second round : Three parts
a) description about recent project done ,mainly focused on architecture
b) Technical questions on web services
c) Related to DB connection pool
Third Round : Company values related by leadership

============================================================================================================

Rate Limit Program and
Design and develop Voting system
LC Easy on string manipulation

==========================================================================================================

1) API Rate Limiter
2) string parsing and hashmap


==============================================================================================================


Design API Rate limiter.

Explain complete functioning of a web page submission and processing (DNS, Http Methods, Request Response Headers, Cookies, Content Type, How MVC frameworks usually works, CORS, SSL/TLS, TCP/UDP) etc.

System Design - Common tagging service used by multiple products to store tags applied on the contents of these products.

======================================================================================================================================

Code Interview with 3 sections, the code was supplied. 3 sections of questions. First one is TDD and little bug fixing. Second is feature development. Third one is making the code multithreaded.

I had time to go through only the first 2 sections so no multithreading questions were asked.

The recruiter came back and told me I did just fine, and that I needed to prove more.

Another technical round was set up. this one was bit thorough, talked about my project and deep dig on what/why of some decisions. Then Security related questions were asked. Then there was a design exercise, where I had to implement new feature and required to take care of some edge conditions and workflow related issues in the feature.

That went well, we had some post interview discussions about how Atlassian works etc.

After this recruiter came back and wanted to discuss which team and level I would be offered if I proceeded to the final stage and how much money will be offered. It was a pay cut for me so I did not proceed further with the role.

Interview Questions
Why do you like Java?
1 Answer
Java memory model and how GC works?
Answer Question
How you will fight concurrency problems in NodeJS? How that different from Java?
Answer Question
How you avoid ConcurrentModificationException? They don't want to hear about Java concurrent collections, more how would you do it without them.
Answer Question

=============================================================================================================================

Interview Questions
Implement Permissions
Answer Question
Implement auto assign ticket algo
Answer Question

==========================================================


talking about pair programming you should be familiar with Junit + mockito and basic core java and collections , they will share a zip file containing a project (simple core java based ) having Junit test cases , and a pdf file containing several tasks like fixing a code / writing junit for specific method/functionality ,
key thing here is to understand the project because tasks in the pdf are very simple if you understand the project completely .

================================================================================================

System design concepts and string related coding problem

===================================================================================================

They focus in multi threading and you can handle it.
And also they check if you are good team player.

=================================================================

====================================================

Implement a known coding pattern from scratch and explain along the decisions made there.

===========================================================

Third Round: Java Concurrency Problem. Factory design pattern.

===================================================================

Among the questions/coding tasks I remember:

* Find a common ancestor in a graph
* Solve a problem using the Either Haskell datatype but implemented in Java
* How the Java Classloader works
* Extend and write some unit test on an proposed architecture
* Write a parser for a hellish file
